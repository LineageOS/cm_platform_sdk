I will add in a loadSettings method to load in defaults when the CMSettingsProvider\u0027s onCreate is called (which will happen prior to services starting). Services such as PowerManagerService (as part of a later change) will then register a content observer on CMSettingsProvider for specific settings so that when the migration happen on PRE_BOOT_COMPLETE, the services will be notified accordingly.",
